Can you even feel? 
Your heart pounding heavily 
Your jaw clenching 
The subtle pulsing pain of your feet 
Walking on the hot concrete. 

Can you even feel your body? 
Or are you drowning in sensations 
Such as that you cannot name the water 
As it equals the air you breathe. 
That heavy grey air - 
Scratching the back of your throat 
Making your lungs cough 
So weak in that soft chest. 

Do you even know what feeling is? 
Or can you not name it cause all you know is hurt? 
So there is no depth you want to go explore 
Just a thin line to walk on without falling down 
Or at least so do you think. 
But you wouldn’t know you’re falling if you did. 
And you are. !

Do you even know what falling feels like? 
If you listen, you do. 
Let it go, feel your body, feel it all. 

Do you even know what you feel? 
It’s called free fall.
