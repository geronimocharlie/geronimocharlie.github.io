When is a moment a moment — and when is it forever?
I have no sense of what is now and what is never
Everything is lost one way or the other
Even the memory we make of one another.

But still, with great greed, we go out and hunt
Try to leave nothing unsaid and nothing undone
And we stretch and bend to outrun death, 'cause we cannot grasp it.
Isn’t death just a concept anyway?

And we try to remember not to forget.
Living to our nature's debt.
Well, isn't life just a concept anyway?

And still, we are drifting and floating and fading away
— all day every day
The more I get to know you, the more I will forget
The more the image of you becomes a concept in my head
Well, isn’t love just a concept anyway?

And every concept comes with a decision
So I decide to accept that I will reside and drop dead
— could happen any sec
I decide to seize the living and join the chase
'Cause if there is no point anyway I still like to make a case:
Celebrating imperfect and impermanence with great resistance
The true beauty in forever lies in its non-existence!

I cannot unlearn, I cannot unsee — my joy will never be truly real for me
And so I learned not to doubt the question but live the answer
As nature’s greatest dancer I live, I love and I die
Never will be I the master of my own time.

It is blinding me but leaves one last light of hope
One last probe to cling to dearly
As I keep on living, whatsoever, thinking clearly
'Cause I cannot know:
When is a moment a moment — and when is it forever?
And what is a moment anyway — if not forever.
