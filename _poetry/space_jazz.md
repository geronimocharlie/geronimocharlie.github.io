This is how it works these days: 
You describe what you want to feel like in max 3 words, 
Hit the button, press play,
Smoke some herbs,
Call it self-care, safe play, self-love... 
And then we spin and spin and turn.

What we pay to get to an all-time high(?) 
They say flow is what makes you forget your existence. 
Cheering that’s fly man, that’s fly, 
But didn’t you read the terms and conditions? 
It will all crash and blow, and we will ever be so low. 
And so we spin and spin and burn.

Can’t you flow with this constant tick? 
Tick-tock tick of the time we don’t have.
Saying so sick, bro, so sick, 
Protest with ignorant joy because we just can. 
Freaky Fridays of no future, go or not to go. 
And so we spin and grin and stop.

Or at least we tried.
