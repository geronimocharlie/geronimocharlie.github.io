My feet, they have a craving
And if they had a mouth to sing
They would twitch and chatter hungrily
Ruthlessly demanding me:

”Bring us soft forest ground
Moist warm clouds of humming life and whistle sounds
Smooth cool stones and ancient roots
Crispy twigs - but leave your boots!
We want to rest in mother’s nest - 
Bring us nature’s best!

And so I leave into the green
Setting out with hope but soon am stuck on gravel roads
And even without eyes my feet can see
Pointing it out shamelessly:

”This ground is fake and hard
Full of strange stones - razor sharp!
And they are cutting up our will to be
In the dark among the trees

And so angst and shame creep up on me
Of intruding on the forest’s peace
That might bear danger - wolves and hounds!
But I sense the missing sounds
Know this place is tame - not wild and free
Long lost is the mother tree

So I take my feet and run, have to leave this funeral
And back in town I lock them up in cages of material
I cannot bear their cries thus I take their air to breathe
Try to suffocate their longing for a lukewarm summer breeze
And for a ground they call their home, long lost in memory
Still wonder how they know of it in all this misery
