My first experiences as a moderator happened in 2025, in collaboration with my friend and artist [**Kaustav Majumdar**](https://www.shopideakou.com/).  

I was involved in the final preparations for his solo exhibition **#TRUTH** at [Kunstraum Nigra Monaĥejo]() in Freiburg—and had the honor of opening the vernissage. Later, I returned to moderate a music event set among the works, where visual art, music, and movement came together in one intense evening.  


### #Truth


> *“At the core of this exhibition is a human catastrophe we’ve become dangerously used to: the deaths of refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean. These are not faceless numbers. These are people who never arrived.”*  

The exhibition was centered arount a documentation of all the depths happening in the Mediterranean Sea over decades - Kaustav sat down to read each entry, give each person a space and even incorporate parts of the list into his art work. He used minimal materials for little money, even using trash, designing his artwork that they were both soothing and shocking.

> *“This exhibition is raw. Intentional. Contemporary. It’s not designed to soothe you—it’s meant to shock you.”*  

> *“Kaustav doesn’t just create images—he creates experiences. His work invites us not only to see, but to feel.”*

### Sound of life.

On the final evening of the exhibition, I moderated the event [**Sound of Life / der Klang des Lebens**](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJla0o7sq9C/?igsh=ZHBleDM0eno5ZXFv) with cellist **Rieke Dietmann** and dancer/violinist **Meret Sue**, who performed an improvised dialogue of sound and movement in resonance with the exhibition.  

> *“Truth doesn’t just sit on walls—it vibrates. It moves. It breathes. And tonight, that breath takes form in sound and movement.”*  

It was a moving evening — part reflection, part response — that left me with goosebumps and gratitude.
