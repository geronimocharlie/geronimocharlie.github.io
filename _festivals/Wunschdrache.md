When on festivals, I like to create art that you can move with and that moves people. 
My first project like this was the "Wishing Dragon" - a recycled children's kite that had the air of a shooting star. It was fun to dance with and when passing people, I prompted them to write down a wish on one of the dragon's many tails. 

Some interactions were just funny - some were deeply personal. 
Here I would like to put up these many wishes, maybe they get fullfilled.
