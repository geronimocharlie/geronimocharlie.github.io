Over the past three summers, I have been part of several festivals that merge art, music, and community — working my way from volunteer to team lead in technical and production roles.  

---

### [Bucht der Träumer Festival](https://www.bucht-der-traeumer.de/)
My festival journey began in **2023** as a volunteer in **volunteer management**.  
In **2024**, I joined the **lighting technician teams** for *Mirage* and *Lumina*, the festival’s workshop areas — and by **2025**, I served as **Head of Technical Operations** for the *Lumina* area.  

That year, I was responsible for organizing the **technical setup** for workshop and performance stages, coordinating **artist technical riders**, and creating the **shift schedule** for the team.  
I also oversaw both **setup** and **dismantling** processes, ensuring everything ran smoothly from start to finish.  

A particular focus of my role was developing and implementing **AI-driven live caption generation** for workshops — enabling real-time bilingual accessibility between German and English participants.

###  [Mystic Creatures Festival](https://mysticcreaturesfestival.com/)
At **Mystic Creatures 2024**, I began as a general volunteer, supporting several areas before joining the **electricity and lighting team**.  
I returned in **2025** to contribute again — this time creating **small-scale light installations** and assisting with the **technical setup** of ambient and creative spaces.  

---

### [Evolve Festival](https://www.evolve-festival.com/de/)
In **2025**, I joined the **Evolve Festival** team as **Stage Manager** for the *Ecstatic Dance Stage (Nirvana)*.  
My responsibilities included coordinating artists and transitions between performances, overseeing **technical setup and soundchecks**, and ensuring a smooth flow throughout the stage program.  

---

These experiences deepened my skills in **technical production, stage coordination, and team communication** — and taught me that behind every moment of magic on stage lies an intricate web of light, sound, and collaboration.
