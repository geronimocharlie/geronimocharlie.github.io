Back in 2021, I had the chance to go to South Africa on a **DAAD bird scholarship** to work on *individual bird recognition using deep learning* together with [Dr. Mandlenkosi Gwetu](https://ie-datascience.sun.ac.za/staff/#Prof-Mandla-V-Gwetu) at the [University of KwaZulu-Natal]((https://ukzn.ac.za/)). The goal was to enable automatic bird counting in large national parks. The start of it was first building a dataset on individual birds using Raspberry Pi cameras in collaboration with the [Fallen Angels Bird Sanctuary](https://www.instagram.com/fallenangelsbirdsanctuary/) (who knew their parrots deeply) and test whether neural networks (e.g. Siamese nets) could identify individual birds like African Grey Parrots.  The Sanctuary was interested in such a software as they had a big problem with illegal bird traficking and wanted to identify rightful owners of lost parrots from reference images.

In practice… I spent more time wrestling with Raspberry Pis, power supplies, and field setups than training models... But it was my first real hands-on research experience, and I learned a lot—not only technically, but also about cultural (mis)understandings, adapting in the field, and of course: traveling.  

Fun fact: I even started a [blog for friends and family](https://rainbow-wings.jimdofree.com/) (password: *regenbogen*), but discontinued it before I could share the best leopard shots. One day, I’ll upload them here—if a year has passed and I haven’t: please spam and scold me!

This was the first step in my journey into applied machine learning for nature conservation, and it remains a colorful memory full of both challenges and adventures.
