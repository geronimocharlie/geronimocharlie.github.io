For my bachelor thesis *Improving Physical Consistency in ML-driven Radiative Transfer Parameterization for Climate Model Emulation*, I worked on integrating physically motivated machine learning methods into [ClimART](https://github.com/RolnickLab/climart), a benchmark for atmospheric radiative transfer emulation.  

Supervised by [Christoph Irrgang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=55xXFRYAAAAJ&hl=de) at the [GFZ Helmholtz Centre Potsdam](https://www.gfz.de/en/section/earth-system-modelling/overview), my work focused on developing and testing constraint-based approaches to improve the physical validity and generalization of ML parameterizations. The project contributed to advancing the base projects as I was able to spot a physically inconsistent behaviour of the machine learning models used by the inital ClimART project (yay me), which was subsequently corrected.
