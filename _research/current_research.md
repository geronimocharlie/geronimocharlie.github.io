I recently started working as a research assistant at the [GeoSense Lab](https://uni-freiburg.de/enr-geosense/) (University of Freiburg, Faculty of Environment and Natural Resources, lead: Teja Kattenborn). The project focuses on predicting global plant functional traits by combining crowdsourced biodiversity data with Earth observation predictors, building on the [Global Plant Trait Mapping study](https://geosense-freiburg.github.io/global-traits/) (under review).  

A central part of my work involves adapting [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/), a valuable AutoML toolkit that has proven useful for applied studies by non-ML experts. However, it does not yet support key challenges inherent to environmental dataâ€”**spatial heterogeneity, non-IID sampling, and multi-target prediction**. My research aims to extend this direction by benchmarking methods, testing joint trait prediction, and exploring approaches that integrate spatial and ecological context.  

This collaboration is co-supervised by [Teja Kattenborn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pgzIvAcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Daniel Lusk](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tp6k3j8AAAAJ&hl=en) (GeoSense Lab), and [Lennart Purucker](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/profile/purucker/) (AutoML Lab).
