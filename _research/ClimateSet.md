[ClimateSet](https://climateset.github.io/) is a project focused on building large-scale datasets and benchmarks to advance machine learning for climate science.  

I contributed first as an intern at Mila, [Quebec Institute for Artifical Intelligence](https://mila.quebec/en), and later as an independent remote research consultant for over a year. My work included developing the initial framework, implementing baselines and custom models, and conducting experiments that contributed to the publication at NeurIPS 2023.
