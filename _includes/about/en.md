**Researcher, programmer, writer, arts lover, and dancer (of thought).**{: .page-subtitle}

I work at the intersection of machine learning and climate science, exploring how data and models can help us understand and protect the natural world. My academic path has taken me through cognitive science, environmental science, and interdisciplinary collaborations that link technology with ecological considerations.

For me, research and technology are inseparable from creativity. I draw inspiration from both, and they continually shape how I think and make. Though not an established artist, I pursue projects in poetry and a book in progress, while also engaging in art exhibition moderations, festival organization and technical work, and musical explorations. These activities, alongside my academic training, let me move between analysis and imagination, precision and play.

At the heart of my work lies a concern for sustainability — not only in an environmental sense, but also as the practice of sustaining our capacity to wonder. To care for the world begins with being moved by it, and that involves opening up to the wonder of others while also sharing one’s own.
