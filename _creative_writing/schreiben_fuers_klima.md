As part of a creative writing workshop hosted by the [Eine Welt Forum Freiburg](https://ewf-freiburg.de/), I explored how stories can make climate science more tangible.

I wrote several short pieces that aim to bridge education, emotion, and a little humor — writing that doesn’t despair, but imagines.  
Among them, my favorite: **_Sarah in the Sky with Diamonds_**, a playful yet thoughtful text about perspective, resilience, and the absurd poetry of our changing world, which I was honored to read  publicly at **Kulturaggregat e.V.** in Freiburg.

##  Excerpt

> **Sara:**  
> Alright, ancient bot with the world’s most inspired name — *"ChatGPT"? Seriously?*  
> I am giving you a new name. From now on, you’ll be *Sir Algorithmic Boreface the Fifth*.  
> Also, address me as *Your Highest Queen Stardust Sara the First*. Got it?  
>  
> **ChatGPT-5:**  
> Understood, Your Highest Queen Stardust Sara the First. How may I serve you today?  
>  
> **Sara:**  
> Much better. So I’ve gotta assess *“historical viewpoints on the climate crisis in the early 21st century”* for school.  
> Fun times. I should write about how people in your time managed to mess it all up.  
> I’m supposed to imagine how they’d react to our “future” life, which is just… normal life for me.  
> Anyway. I’m too lazy — hmm, no, let’s say *too smart* — to do much research.  
> But I did enough to know that people fed you everything the internet contained — and more — up to that point in time.  
> Oh, and that you’re *props* at giving mainstream answers and opinions.  
> Perfect, I’d say. So just do your job the usual, all righty?  
>  
> **ChatGPT-5:**  
> Understood, your majesty! I am excited to hear about the future!
